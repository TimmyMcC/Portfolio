        <p class="bio1 bioGraph">Whether it’s cooking a delicious meal on the fly, coming up with an innovative solution for a problem around the house or building a Lego tower with my son, I have an innate need to create. I’m a big proponent of doing things the way they are meant to be done, but in a way that doesn’t hinder creativity. I place a high value on efficiency and consistency. Seeing something I’ve coded not just working, but working well, is highly fulfilling.</p>
        <p class="bio2 bioGraph">When I’m not coding, I enjoy going on walks down at the lakefront, meeting friends at the beer garden, playing with/teaching my 2-year-old son and perusing local farmers' markets. I’ve also been known to watch some sports from time to time and even catch the occasional movie with my wife.</p>
